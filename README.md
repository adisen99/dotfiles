# Dotfiles

![Logo](./images/logo.png)

These are the personal config files, Wallpapers, fonts (and more) of adisen99-

Most of the shell scripts and rc files are personlised for my workstation.

You are welcome to use any of the configs but please be careful as to what to keep and what to discard and only use these files if you are absolutely certain about what you are doing.

## HAPPY CODING :)
